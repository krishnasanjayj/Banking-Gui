BANKING SYSTEM

BANKING SYSTEM is a comprehensive banking management application designed to digitalize and streamline day-to-day banking operations through a secure and user-friendly platform. The system supports both desktop-based banking operations and online banking services, enabling efficient management of financial transactions for bank staff as well as convenient access for customers.

The application is developed using Java for the desktop workstation module and PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the online banking interface, with MS-SQL Server as the backend database connected through an ODBC connector. It follows a modular architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and ease of future enhancements.

The system provides role-based access for different banking departments such as administration, accounts, cashier operations, loan management, and e-banking services. Bank staff can securely manage customer accounts, deposits, withdrawals, fund transfers, loan details, and transaction records through an intuitive graphical user interface. Proper data validation, confirmation mechanisms, and structured workflows are implemented to ensure accuracy and reliability in financial operations.

For customers, the online banking module offers facilities such as account creation requests, balance inquiry, transaction history viewing, fund transfers, loan status tracking (ongoing and completed), and wallet-based transactions. The system also integrates a dedicated payment module to support third-party transfers, enhancing flexibility and transparency in digital transactions.

The BANKING SYSTEM emphasizes simplicity in design while maintaining robust functionality. By converting traditional manual banking processes into a computerized and partially online model, the system significantly reduces transaction time, improves operational efficiency, and strengthens interaction between the bank and its customers.

Overall, this project demonstrates a practical implementation of core banking concepts, combining desktop and web technologies to deliver a reliable, secure, and extensible banking solution suitable for real-world cooperative or small-scale banking environments.
